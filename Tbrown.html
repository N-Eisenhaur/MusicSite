                <p class="pageText">Tamar has always gravitated towards music.

                </p>

                <p class="pageText">From singing in small bands and coffee houses in high school, singing with church
                    choirs, or belting out the Preacher’s Wife soundtrack with her three children, singing and music
                    hold some of the best memories of her life.</p>

                <p class="pageText">Instinctively and with encouragement from her children, Tamar began singing and
                    performing with the award winning Nova Scotia Mass Choir. Tamar first saw the NSMC at the 1992
                    International Gospel Festival held in Halifax and became even more enthralled with gospel music.
                    While with the choir, and her term as President in the choir’s 25th and 26th years, Tamar had the
                    opportunity to be engaged with the “behind the scenes” music industry and fell in love with the
                    environment and its people.</p>

                <p class="pageText">Tamar comes by the music industry naturally as her grandfather, Roger Pryor, was a
                    piano player and singer in Harlem, New York, until he passed in the 1980’s.</p>

                <p class="pageText">Tamar brings to the table a degree from Saint Mary’s University, where she also was
                    Vice President of Student Affairs for the Organization of Part-Time and Mature University Students.
                    This is where Tamar first started planning events and gained an exuberance for getting things done.
                    Tamar has an honest and straight-forward approach and encourages the same with her team and artists.
                </p>

                <p class="pageText">“When you are part of the Pryor Management Team, that means you are family, and as
                    family we can accomplish anything together!”</p>
