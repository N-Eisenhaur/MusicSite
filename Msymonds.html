                <p class="pageText">
                    For close to 50 years, Marcell has established himself as a household name when it comes to black
                    male vocalists in Nova Scotia. Marcell presents a smooth crooning style, yet powerful voice.
                    Marcell’s dynamic and enchanting personality can quickly captivate his audience. </p>

                <p class="pageText"> Recognizing his
                    passion for singing, his parents, the late Rev. and Mrs. Calvin Symonds enrolled him into the
                    Maritime Conservatory of Music when he was nine years old. Marcell excelled over the next seven
                    years and received his diploma for voice honors, while he continued to sing in church collectively
                    as well as a soloist. </p>

                <p class="pageText">Marcell was chosen as one of only four Nova Scotians selected to perform at
                    the Second World Black, and African Festival of Arts and Culture, which was held in Lagos, Nigeria,
                    Africa. Marcell experienced a trip of a lifetime and everlasting memories performing in the
                    “Motherland”. Marcell continues to receive unlimited invitations to entertain as an announcer,
                    emcee, jingle singer, lead singer for bands as well as a soloist. His versatility in all genres and
                    his contagious energy are a delight!</p>

                <p class="pageText">To his credit, Marcell boasts a gospel CD, “Just a Closer Walk”
                    (Sharp 5 Productions), and has an acoustical project underway. </p>

                <p class="pageText">Marcell looks forward with an
                    uncontrollable enthusiasm as he continues to warm the hearts of all who hear him sing.
