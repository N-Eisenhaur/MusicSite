                <p class="pageText">Keonté Beals is a 23 year-old singer, songwriter, piano player, and dancer. Keonté
                    is making a splash in the East Coast music scene as a multi-talented, award-winning R&B/Pop artist.
                    His soulful songs are straight from the heart, and can take fans back to the early 90s feel, when
                    R&B/Pop singles dominated the airwaves for the first time. </p>
                    
                    <p class="pageText"> Born and raised in the community of North
                    Preston in Nova Scotia, Keonté started singing and performing at the age of seven. As a young teen,
                    he joined the choir at his local parish and discovered his true passion for entertainment. The
                    experience led to more opportunities for Keonté to perform at churches and events in the HRM, all of
                    which helped him develop his skills and build a fan base for his music. </p>
                    
                    <p class="pageText">Keonté continued to invest
                    his energy into vocal training and dance, and after graduating from high school, he enrolled in the
                    Music Arts program at NSCC. In 2014, he recorded and released a cover of the song “I’m Here” from
                    the movie soundtrack, The Color Purple, and credits this move as the start of his professional music
                    career. The video was an internet sensation and grabbed the attention of Prismatic Arts Festival
                    artistic director, Shahin Sayadi, who booked Keonté for his first festival show. </p>
                    
                    <p class="pageText">  In late 2016,
                    Keonté released his debut single, “Man Down” from his self-titled EP, and a second single, “4 Ever”
                    in February 2017. </p>
                    
                    <p class="pageText"> Not only is Keonté a natural-born entertainer, he has received awards and
                    nominations from Music Nova Scotia, the African Nova Scotia Music Association, the Coast Halifax,
                    and the East Coast Music Association for his recorded music. Keonté is also a recipient of the
                    Partnership of Hope Award presented by Challenge AIDS, and Malaria in Africa (CHAMA), and was
                    recognized by the Honorable Keith Colwell with an MLA Rising Star award for his musical success and
                    community service earlier this year. </p>
                    
                    <p class="pageText">Keonte was recently awarded the African Nova Scotian ‘Artist of
                    the Year Award’ for 2019. </p>
                    
                    <p class="pageText">Keonte is currently working on a full length project that will be released
                    early summer 2020. </p>
